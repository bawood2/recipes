Scrambled Eggs

A breakfast classic.

Ingrediants 
3 eggs
1/4 cup of whole milk
1/4 cup favorite cheese
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
salt and pepper to taste

Whisk eggs, milk, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper in a medium size bowl.
Add mixtures to a skillet and cook over medium-low heat. Stir/scramble periodically.
When eggs begin to form solid, but still look a little wet, stir in cheese.  Once cheese
melts, serve hot and eat!
